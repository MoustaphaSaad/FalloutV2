FalloutV2
=========

The little Game Engine is back with version 2.0

The idea of this engine is to be a portable as possible just you need to hook it up to your c++ project and start using it, maybe someday it will have a gui interface but we will always keep it as a small tool used on demand

Current target:
-Scene structure
-Materials & unified shaders
-OpenGL & DirectX support
-Targeting windows platform
-Basic Lighting & Shadows
-Simple Level Of Detail
-Mesh Loading
